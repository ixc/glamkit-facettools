Now:
* Front-end views
* Implement storage for facet items. I think a simple cache value will do. We
 have to make sure the cache is thread-safe, ie that it doesn't store items
 based on the request (instead, unfiltered items)
* Allow one FacetGroup to be applied to multiple collections

Later:
* Generate a sentence based on selected facets
